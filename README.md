## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Editor Not Appearing

**Problem:** No floating toggle button visible
**Solutions:**
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Verify embed script URL is correct
- Ensure you have admin permissions on CXone Expert

### CSS Not Saving

**Problem:** Save button does nothing or shows error
**Solutions:**
- Check that you're logged in to CXone Expert
- Verify you have permission to edit CSS
- Try refreshing and loading the editor again
- Check browser console for error messages

### Changes Disappear After Page Reload

**Problem:** CSS reverts to previous version
**Solutions:**
- Click "Save All" before closing (not just preview)
- Check that save completed successfully (green checkmark)
- Verify localStorage is enabled in your browser

### Editor is Slow or Laggy

**Problem:** Performance issues when typing
**Solutions:**
- Close other browser tabs to free memory
- Disable live preview toggle if too slow
- Try refreshing the page
- Clear browser cache

### localStorage Quota Exceeded

**Problem:** "Storage quota exceeded" error
**Solutions:**
- Export your CSS before clearing
- Clear old localStorage data in DevTools
- Typical quota: 5-10MB per domain

### Can't See Live Preview

**Problem:** Changes don't appear until saved
**Solutions:**
- Ensure live preview toggle is ON (check for indicator)
- Try typing in the editor to trigger preview
- Refresh page and re-open editor

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Is this safe to use in production?**
A: Yes! The latest version is stable and tested. For maximum safety, use a pinned version.

**Q: Will this slow down my site?**
A: No. The embed script is tiny (~10KB) and loads asynchronously. Editors only load when you click the toggle button.

**Q: Can I use this on multiple CXone Expert sites?**
A: Yes! Just add the embed script to each site's `<head>`.

**Q: What happens if I have unsaved changes and close the editor?**
A: Your changes are preserved in localStorage. Re-open the editor to continue editing.

**Q: Can multiple people edit CSS at the same time?**
A: The editor doesn't have real-time collaboration. Last save wins. Coordinate with your team to avoid conflicts.

**Q: How do I uninstall?**
A: Simply remove the `<script>` tag from your site's `<head>`. No other cleanup needed.

**Q: Does this work offline?**
A: No. The editor requires internet connection to load Monaco Editor from CDN.

**Q: Which browsers are supported?**
A: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+. Modern browsers only.

**Q: Can I customize the colors or position?**
A: Not yet, but configurable options are planned (#48). For now, you can drag/resize the overlay.

**Q: Where is my CSS actually saved?**
A: Two places: (1) CXone Expert's database when you click "Save All", (2) Your browser's localStorage as a backup.
